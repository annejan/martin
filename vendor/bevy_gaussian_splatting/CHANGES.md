# Local fork — change log

**Forked from:** `bevy_gaussian_splatting` **7.0.2** (crates.io), patched in via
`[patch.crates-io]` in `../../Cargo.toml`. (Rebased 7.0.1 → 7.0.2: the only upstream
code change since 7.0.1 was the `DynamicUniformIndex<CloudUniform>` fix in the radix
dispatch (#228), now incorporated in `src/sort/radix.rs` underneath our sort edits.)

This file lists every edit we made to the upstream sources, so the fork can be
re-applied (or dropped) when bumping the crate. Keep it current when you touch the
vendor tree. To see the raw diff against a clean 7.0.1 checkout:

```bash
cargo package --no-verify  # or: download the 7.0.2 .crate and `diff -ru`
```

Feature selection (e.g. `sh0`) is **not** a fork — it's set in `../../Cargo.toml`
(`default-features = false, features = [...]`). The vendor `Cargo.toml` is upstream.

## 1. Custom render-shader effects  (`src/render/gaussian.wgsl`)

Injected after `var position = get_position(...)`:

- **Explode displacement** — closed-form ballistic per-gaussian offset driven by
  `gaussian_uniforms.time`, gated `time != 0 && !interp_active` (so it only fires for
  plain explode-mode clouds, never a morph output).
- **Morph "ball cloud" pulse** — when `interp_active` (an interpolation range is set) and
  `gaussian_uniforms.bulge > 0`, routes each gaussian onto a fuzzy sphere by
  `sin(pi*t)` (zero at t=0/1, max mid) so a morph disperses into a ball and reassembles.

Both rely on `explode_hash3(splat_index)` (also added here).

*Why a fork:* the crate loads shaders by hardcoded UUID (`load_internal_asset!`) — there
is no app-side hook to extend the WGSL. This is the core reason the fork exists.

## 2. New uniform field `bulge`  (4 spots — must stay in sync)

Drives the ball-pulse amplitude per cloud. `encase`/std140 layout couples these:

- `src/render/bindings.wgsl` — `bulge: f32` in `struct GaussianUniforms` (after `time_stop`).
- `src/render/mod.rs` — `bulge: f32` in `pub struct CloudUniform` (after `time_stop`) **and**
  `bulge: settings.bulge` in its construction.
- `src/gaussian/settings.rs` — `pub bulge: f32` in `CloudSettings` + `bulge: 0.0` in `Default`.

> Fragile on upgrade: if upstream changes `CloudUniform`'s field order, re-check alignment.

## 3. Sort optimizations  (`src/sort/radix.{rs,wgsl}`, `src/render/mod.rs`)

~2.4× faster radix sort on the iGPU, correctness preserved (LSD-stable, reads live GPU
positions → no holes). **Opened upstream as mosure/bevy_gaussian_splatting#229** (branch
`perf/radix-sort-2x` on the `annejan/bevy_gaussian_splatting` fork, based on 7.0.2 main).

- `render/mod.rs` `ShaderDefines::default()` — `radix_digit_places = 2` (was `32/bits` = 4):
  16-bit depth key → halves the radix C-pass cost (65536 buckets is ample).
- `sort/radix.wgsl` `radix_sort_a` — store `key = key >> 16u` (sort the high 16 bits, to
  match the 2 passes).
- `sort/radix.wgsl` `radix_sort_c_scan_tiles` — `@workgroup_size(RADIX_BASE)`, lane = digit
  (was `@workgroup_size(1)` × RADIX_BASE single-lane workgroups, 1/64 wave occupancy).
- `sort/radix.wgsl` `radix_sort_c_scatter` — per-digit COUNT parallelized across all lanes
  (atomic into `tile_digit_counts`); the stable placement stays serial (LSD requires it).
- `sort/radix.rs` — `radix_sort_c_scan` dispatch `(1,1,1)` (was `(1, radix_base, 1)`);
  dropped the now-unused `radix_base` local.

## 4. Per-particle transition phase  (`gaussian.wgsl` + 4 uniform spots — opt-in, default-off)

Enables staggered *per-particle* transitions a single global `time` can't express
(typewriter, slither, sparkle, true vortex, hard wipe). **`transition_mode == 0` is the
default and is byte-identical to upstream.** Append-only + default-off ⇒ a clean candidate to
**upstream as a PR**. Full reference: `../../SHADER-BLUEPRINT.md`.

- `src/render/gaussian.wgsl` — `transition_phase(index, position) -> f32` helper (after
  `explode_hash3`); a gated branch in `vs_points` (after the ball-pulse) computing a moving
  window `local = saturate((gt*(1+softness) - phase)/softness)` → `tx_reveal` (opacity sink)
  or a position nudge (slither / vortex); and one factor at the color finalize,
  `opacity * global_opacity * tx_reveal` (`* 1.0` ⇒ no-op in mode 0). if/else-if, not switch (RADV).
- New uniform group (4 spots, like `bulge`): `transition_mode: u32`, `transition_softness: f32`,
  `transition_axis: u32`, `_transition_pad: u32` — appended **after `max: vec4`** (the true
  struct end, **NOT** after `bulge`) in `bindings.wgsl` `GaussianUniforms`, `mod.rs`
  `CloudUniform` (+ its construction), and `gaussian/settings.rs` `CloudSettings` (+ `Default`:
  mode 0 / softness 0.15 / axis 0).

> Lives in `vs_points` (runs *after* the sort) → invisible to the radix sort; do **not** move
> it into `interpolate.wgsl` (that buffer is what the sort reads). Pure fn of `splat_index` +
> position + uniforms ⇒ deterministic in record mode.

## 5. Persistent vertex deform  (`gaussian.wgsl` + 4 uniform spots — opt-in, default-off)

A continuous, *non-morph* displacement so a held shape keeps moving (a waving "wall of text":
wave/cloth/ripple/twist/**wind**). Unlike §4 (gated to `interp_active`, plays once over a morph), this is
driven by `deform_time` and runs **every frame**. **`deform_mode == 0` is the default and is
byte-identical to upstream.** Append-only + default-off ⇒ also a clean candidate to upstream.

- `src/render/gaussian.wgsl` — a gated branch in `vs_points` **after** the transition block and
  **before** `transformed_position` (so the deform is in object space, pre-transform). Displaces
  `position` by a per-mode function of its centred coords + `deform_time`. if/else-if, not switch.
  Modes 1-4 (wave/cloth/ripple/twist); **5** wind (gusting sway), **6** turbulence (churning 3D
  field), **7** pulse (breathe in/out about the centre), **8** jitter (fast per-particle shake), **9**
  spiral (radial pinwheel about the vertical axis). All append-only `else if` branches gated by
  `deform_mode != 0u`, so mode 0 stays byte-identical to upstream.
- New uniform group (4 spots, like §2/§4): `deform_mode: u32`, `deform_amp: f32`,
  `deform_freq: f32`, `deform_time: f32` — a **second 16-byte block appended after the transition
  group** (`_transition_pad`) in `bindings.wgsl` `GaussianUniforms`, `mod.rs` `CloudUniform`
  (+ its construction), and `gaussian/settings.rs` `CloudSettings` (+ `Default`: all 0).

> Same sort caveat as §4: lives in `vs_points`, invisible to the radix sort. Amplitudes are small
> so the depth-sort error is negligible. The app advances `deform_time` from the show clock.

## 6. Swarm morph detour  (`gaussian.wgsl` + 4 uniform spots — opt-in, default-off)

`swarm: f32` (0 = off → byte-identical). During a morph (`interp_active`) each gaussian curls along
its own pseudo-random + tangential (about the vertical axis) direction by `sin(pi*t)*swarm` — peaks
mid-transition, **exactly zero at t=0/t=1** so both endpoints stay pixel-exact, like §2's ball-pulse.
The effect: a shape→shape morph *flocks/swarms* between the two scenes instead of lerping straight
(the app's `~swarm` transition). Same injection point as §1/§2, right after the ball-pulse block.

- New uniform group (4 spots, like §2/§4/§5): `swarm: f32` + three `_swarm_pad` f32 — a **third
  16-byte block appended after the deform group** in `bindings.wgsl` `GaussianUniforms`, `mod.rs`
  `CloudUniform` (+ its construction), and `gaussian/settings.rs` `CloudSettings` (+ `Default`: 0).

> Same sort caveat as §2/§4. Driven by the morph `time`, so it self-cancels at the endpoints.

## 7. Don't claim gltf/glb extensions in the scene loader  (`src/io/scene.rs` — martin app need)

`GaussianSceneLoader` (KHR_gaussian_splatting glTF) claimed `["gltf","glb"]`, shadowing Bevy's native
`GltfLoader`. martin loads its splats from `.ply` and wants Bevy's glTF loader free so it can render
**real PBR meshes alongside the splats** (the app's `model:` compose source — meshes + splats share
the camera + the depth test, so they composite). Changed `extensions()` to return `&[]`; the loader
still exists for explicit type-loads, it just no longer grabs the extension. (One-line, reversible.)

---

## Not a fork (for reference)
- `sh0` vs `sh3`: feature selection in `../../Cargo.toml`.
- `assets/font.ttf`, `build_text_gaussians`, the `GaussianInterpolate` morph, the
  `MARTIN_SEQ` timeline: all live in the **app** (`../../src/main.rs`) and use the crate's
  public API — zero vendor changes.
